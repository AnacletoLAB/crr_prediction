## Notes on installing Ray
We need the very latest version of ray, that can be currently installed from
the tutorial available [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html).

You can identify your python version by running `python -V`.

If you get errors such as `the wheel is not supported` just update your pip installation by using:

```bash
pip install pip -U
```
